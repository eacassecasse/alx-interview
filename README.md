# Algorithm Implementations in Python

Welcome to the **Algorithm Implementations** repository! This repository contains Python solutions for a variety of algorithms, ranging from fundamental concepts to more complex challenges. As new projects are added, this repository will grow to encompass a wide array of problem-solving techniques.

## Current Projects

### 1. [0x00. Pascal's Triangle](./0x00-pascal_triangle)

**Description**:  
This project implements a function to generate Pascal’s Triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients.

**Key Concepts**:
- Lists and List Comprehensions
- Functions and Loops
- Conditional Statements
- Indexing and Slicing
- Efficiency and Optimization

**Function Signature**:
```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
    """
    Returns a list of lists representing the Pascal’s Triangle of n.
    """
```

**Example**:
For `n = 5`, the function returns:
```python
[
 [1],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```

## Requirements
All code in this repository follows these standards:
- All files are executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **Python 3.7+**
- Files should end with a new line
- All projects include a **README.md** at the root of the project folder
- All functions are properly documented

## Setup

To run any project in this repository, first ensure that **Python 3.x** is installed on your system. Navigate to the specific project folder and execute the scripts directly.

For example, to run the Pascal's Triangle project:

```bash
cd 0x00-pascal_triangle
python3 your_script.py
```

## Future Projects
This repository is a work in progress. More algorithmic challenges will be added in the future. Stay tuned for:
- Sorting algorithms
- Graph traversal techniques
- Dynamic programming solutions
- And more!

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, work on your own version of an algorithm, and submit a pull request. Please make sure your code adheres to the repository's style guide.
